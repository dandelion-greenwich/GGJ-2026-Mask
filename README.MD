Masks are dropped for players every 30 seconds. Different masks offer different abilities:



* **The Stone Mask:** Reducing received knockback.

* **The Wing Mask:** Increasing speed and jumping.

* **The Punch Mask:** Increases knockback dealt to other players.



Who will be the first to collect a mask? But, more importantly who will keep the mask? With punches and parries, masks can be stolen from opposing Pou's. 



Players have 3 lives, a knockback multiplier and need to knock other players out of the arena to be victorious.
